# Market Gap Analysis

## A. The Executive Summary
[Insert Summary Here: e.g., "This analysis of the Open Food Facts dataset reveals a significant market gap in low-sugar, high-protein snacks in the West African region. While 60% of current products contain high sugar levels, consumer demand for healthier alternatives is rising. Our predictive model suggests that introducing a plant-based protein bar could capture a 15% market share within the first year."]

## C. Technical Explanation

### Data Cleaning
To ensure analysis accuracy, the following cleaning steps were performed:
1.  **Handling Missing Values:** [e.g., Imputed missing nutritional values using the median of their respective product categories.]
2.  **Duplicate Removal:** [e.g., Removed duplicate entries based on barcode (code) and product name.]
3.  **Outlier Detection:** [e.g., Filtered out products with impossible values (e.g., sugar content > 100g per 100g).]

### Candidate's Choice
For the Candidate's Choice requirement, I implemented [Name of Feature/Analysis].
* **What I did:** [Brief description, e.g., "I added a sentiment analysis on product ingredients to flag potential allergens automatically."]
* **Why:** [Brief justification, e.g., "This feature helps users with dietary restrictions identify safe products instantly."]
