# Market Gap Analysis: Open Food Facts

## A. The Executive Summary
This market analysis of the Open Food Facts dataset reveals a significant "Blue Ocean" opportunity in the Meat & Seafood snack category, which remains underserved compared to the saturated, high-sugar Energy Bar market. The data identifies a specific "Opportunity Zone" for products containing over 37g of protein and less than 1.6g of sugar per 100g, targets that maximize nutritional value for health-conscious consumers. Furthermore, the "Candidate's Choice" complexity analysis confirms that Meat & Seafood snacks offer a decisive "Clean Label" advantage, averaging a median of ~12 ingredients compared to ~25 ingredients in competitor cereal bars. Consequently, the recommended strategy is to launch a high-protein, savory snack that competes on both superior macronutrients and ingredient simplicity.

## C. Technical Explanation

### Data Cleaning Strategy
The data cleaning process was executed in `helpers/task_1.ipynb` and encapsulated in a reusable `wrangle` function. The approach focused on data integrity and removing noise:
1.  **Scope Filtering:** The dataset was strictly subsetted to relevant "Snack" categories.
2.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Dropped columns with >80% missing values and administrative metadata (e.g., `url`, `created_t`, `states_tags`) that offered no analytical value.
3.  **Imputation:** Missing values in `product_name` and `countries_en` were labeled as "Unknown." Statistical mode imputation was used for the `nova_group` (processing level).
4.  **Outlier Removal & Biological Limits:**
    * Removed rows exceeding theoretical nutritional limits (e.g., Energy > 900 kcal/100g, Macronutrients > 100g/100g).
    * Enforced logical constraints (e.g., Saturated Fat must be ≤ Total Fat).
    * Removed Nutri-Score outliers (< -15 or > 40).

### Candidate's Choice: Ingredient Complexity Analysis
For the "Candidate's Choice" requirement, I developed a **Clean Label/Ingredient Complexity Metric**.
* **Goal:** To determine which high-protein categories offer a "cleaner" product profile to appeal to health-conscious consumers avoiding ultra-processed foods (UPFs).
* **Implementation:** I engineered a feature `ingredient_count` by parsing the comma-separated `ingredients_text`.
* **Result:** A comparative analysis revealed that **Meat & Seafood** snacks (Median ~12 ingredients) are significantly "cleaner" than **Energy & Cereal Bars** (Median ~25 ingredients). This strengthens the recommendation to pivot toward savory protein snacks, as they compete on both macronutrients and ingredient simplicity.

## Methodology: Category Engineering

To ensure accurate analysis, raw category data was normalized and reclassified using a **Hierarchical Keyword Matching System**.

### 1. Text Preparation
Fields (`categories_en`, `product_name`) were combined, lowercased, and normalized (hyphens converted to spaces) to create a searchable text string.

### 2. Priority-Based Assignment
Categories were assigned based on a "Waterfall" priority logic—matches at Level 1 override matches at Level 5.

* **Level 1 (Non-Snack/Meals):** Beverages, Supplements, Meals & Sandwiches.
* **Level 2 (High Value/Natural):** Meat & Seafood, Fruit & Veggie, Nuts & Seeds, Dairy.
* **Level 3 (Salty):** Chips & Popcorn.
* **Level 4 (Sweet):** Breakfast/Cereals, Energy Bars, Biscuits/Cakes, Chocolates.
* **Level 5 (Fallback):** Savory Misc, Plant-Based Misc.

*If no keywords matched, the product was labeled "Other Snacks".*

## Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard allows stakeholders to visualize the "Opportunity Zone" (High Protein, Low Sugar).

* **Opportunity Zone Definition:** Products containing **Sugar < 5g/100g** AND **Protein > 20g/100g**.
* **Leaderboard:** Ranks top products by their Protein-to-Sugar ratio.
* **Ingredient Drivers:** Identifies that **Chicken**, **Dairy**, and **Beef** are the primary protein drivers in the current opportunity zone.

```bash
Get-Content "en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csv" -TotalCount 100000 | Set-Content "dataset/openfoodfacts_100k.csv"
```
Mac/Linux (Terminal):
```bash
head -n 100000 en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csv > dataset/openfoodfacts_100k.csv
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Analysis
Open main.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.
